# SecureVault â€“ Your Personal Password Manager

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is **SecureVault**, a password manager I built for my college Object-Oriented Programming project. It's a simple but effective way to keep all your passwords safe and organized, all from your terminal.

## What Can It Do?

### Security First
- Protects everything behind a **master password** that only you know.
- All your passwords get **hashed before storage** (no plain text lying around!).

### Easy Password Management
- Store login info for all your favorite websites.
- Keep **usernames and passwords organized** in one place.
- Delete old accounts you don't use anymore.

### Smart Features
- Need a strong password? The **built-in generator** has you covered.
- Want to see your saved passwords? Just enter your master password again for that extra security layer.
- Clean, simple **menu system** that's easy to navigate.

## Behind the Scenes
I built this using **C++** and focused on applying solid **Object-Oriented Programming principles**. The whole thing runs in your terminal â€“ no fancy graphics, just straightforward functionality that gets the job done.

### What I Used:
- **C++** with STL (Standard Template Library)  
- **OOP concepts** like classes, encapsulation, and data structures  
- **Terminal-based interface** for maximum compatibility

It might not be as fancy as those commercial password managers, but it's secure, functional, and shows off some solid programming fundamentals. Perfect for keeping your digital life organized without any of the bloat!

**Built as part of my college coursework to demonstrate OOP mastery and practical C++ application.**
